# Yelp-Review-Classification
This project builds a classifier to classify Yelp reviews into 1 or 5-star categories based off the text
content in reviews.

# Dataset Used
We will use the [Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013).

Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.

The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better). In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.

The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users.

The "useful" and "funny" columns are similar to the "cool" column.

The data set is imported as yelp.csv.
